Background:
When we listen to a periodic sequence of brief sounds, we may perceive it as being continuous or 
discrete depending on the interval between the sounds. For example, for a periodic sequence of clicks, we 
perceive it as being discrete if the inter-click interval (ICI) is 100 ms (corresponding to a repetition rate
(f0) of 10 Hz, f0 = 1/ICI) or continuous if the ICI is 10 ms (corresponding to f0 =100 Hz). Acoustically, the 
click sequence is discrete in both cases. 

Experiment 2:
An irregular click sequence is produced by using ICIs drawn from a uniform distribution centered at a mean
ICI. For example, for an irregular click sequence with a mean ICI of 20 ms and 10% jitter, ICIs are chosen
from a uniform distribution between [18, 22] ms. Your behavioral task in this experiment is to determine if
a click sequence sounds “aperiodic” or “periodic”.
Obtains psychometric functions for the conditions: ICI = 10ms; 25ms; 100ms

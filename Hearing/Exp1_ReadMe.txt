Background:
When we listen to a periodic sequence of brief sounds, we may perceive it as being continuous or 
discrete depending on the interval between the sounds. For example, for a periodic sequence of clicks, we 
perceive it as being discrete if the inter-click interval (ICI) is 100 ms (corresponding to a repetition rate
(f0) of 10 Hz, f0 = 1/ICI) or continuous if the ICI is 10 ms (corresponding to f0 =100 Hz). Acoustically, the 
click sequence is discrete in both cases. 

Experiment 1:
Script generates 7 distinct periodic sequences of clicks, each with a 
different repetition rate f0 (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 Hz).
Each sequence is played 10 times (for 70 sequences total), all played in random order.
Responses by the user (discrete or continuous) are recorded; after the experiment is over, the script
calculates the boundry frequency- f0- at which the user has a 50% probability of hearing the clicks as continuous.
